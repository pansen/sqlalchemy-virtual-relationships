# SQLAlchemy Special Relationships

This repo is a demo for (yet another) awesome feature of SQLAlchemy (SQLA). 

## Limited Relationships

SQLA provides the ability to create a [limited 1:n relationship via window functions](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/join_conditions.html#row-limited-relationships-with-window-functions).
